**Milestone v1.0 - COMPLETE - ALL DISTRIBUTION TASKS FINISHED**

The mono-quant project has been fully distributed with:
1. ✅ Documentation (GitHub Pages) - MkDocs with Material theme
2. ✅ GitHub Releases (v1.0 and v1.0.1)
3. ✅ PyPI Publishing (mono-quant published and installable)
4. ✅ CI/CD Pipeline - Automated testing, linting, and publishing

**Current Branch:** dev
**Repository:** https://github.com/thatAverageGuy/mono-quant
**PyPI:** https://pypi.org/project/mono-quant/
</current_state>

<completed_work>

## Phase 1: Documentation (GitHub Pages)
- ✅ Created MkDocs configuration
- ✅ Built documentation site with Material theme
- ✅ Created documentation structure:
  - Getting Started (installation, quick start, basic usage)
  - User Guide (modes, calibration, INT4, layer skipping, serialization, validation)
  - CLI Reference (overview, commands)
  - API Reference (all modules)
  - Examples (dynamic INT8, static INT4, custom observer, CI/CD)
  - Advanced (model-agnostic, accuracy tips, performance)
  - About (changelog, contributing, license)
- ✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow for auto-deployment
- ✅ Deployed to: https://thataverageguy.github.io/mono-quant

## Phase 2: GitHub Release
- ✅ Created comprehensive release notes (RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.md)
- ✅ Created v1.0 GitHub release with full feature documentation
- ✅ Installed GitHub CLI
- ✅ Authenticated with GitHub
- ✅ Published release at: https://github.com/thatAverageGuy/mono-quant/releases/tag/v1.0

## Phase 3: PyPI Publishing
- ✅ Fixed safetensors dependency constraint (>=0.4 → >=0.3 for uv compatibility)
- ✅ Built package v1.0.1
- ✅ Published to TestPyPI (testing ground)
- ✅ Published to production PyPI
- ✅ Verified installation with pip and uv
- ✅ Package available at: https://pypi.org/project/mono-quant/

## Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  - Test job: Multi-OS (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) × Multi-Python (3.11, 3.12)
  - Build job: Creates wheel + sdist
  - Publish job: Auto-publishes to PyPI on releases
- ✅ Created test suite (tests/test_api.py)
- ✅ Created pytest configuration
- ✅ Updated .gitignore for test artifacts
- ✅ Created CI/CD documentation (.github/workflows/README.md)
- ✅ Added CI/CD badge to README.md
- ✅ Pushed pipeline to GitHub: https://github.com/thatAverageGuy/mono-quant/actions

<completed_work>

<remaining_work>
**NONE - All distribution tasks complete!**

The project is fully distributed and production-ready:
- Documentation online
- Package on PyPI
- CI/CD pipeline active
- GitHub releases created

**Optional future enhancements:**
- Configure PYPI_API_TOKEN secret for automated publishing
- Add more comprehensive test coverage
- Add performance benchmarks
- Create example notebooks
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

**Dependency Updates:**
- Decided to add numpy as required dependency (not optional) for array operations
- Fixed safetensors constraint from >=0.4 to >=0.3 for uv compatibility
- Moved safetensors, click, tqdm from optional to included dependencies

**Version Management:**
- v1.0.0: Initial release
- v1.0.1: Bug fix for safetensors dependency

**Publishing Strategy:**
- TestPyPI first for safety
- Production PyPI after verification
- Automated publishing with GitHub Actions on releases

**CI/CD Design:**
- Multi-platform testing (3 OS × 2 Python = 6 jobs)
- Automated publishing on GitHub releases (trusted publishing)
- Linting with ruff
- Type checking with mypy
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
**NONE** - All tasks completed successfully.

**Minor setup needed for CI/CD:**
- User needs to add PYPI_API_TOKEN to GitHub secrets
- User needs to configure 'pypi' environment in GitHub settings
- This is one-time setup, not a blocker

</blockers>

**Project Overview:**
Mono Quant is an ultra-lightweight, model-agnostic quantization package for PyTorch. The v1.0 milestone delivered all core features (INT8, INT4, FP16 quantization with calibration, CLI, Python API, validation, serialization).

**Session Summary:**
This session focused entirely on distribution - getting the package published and accessible to users:
1. Set up documentation with GitHub Pages
2. Created GitHub releases
3. Published to PyPI (after fixing dependency issue)
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline for future releases

**Approach:**
- Incremental distribution: Documentation → GitHub Release → TestPyPI → PyPI → CI/CD
- Each step verified before moving to next
- Fixed issues as they arose (safetensors dependency)
- Used industry-standard tools (MkDocs, GitHub CLI, twine, build)

**Current Status:**
The project is fully distributed and production-ready. Users can now:
- Install via `pip install mono-quant`
- Read docs at https://thataverageguy.github.io/mono-quant
- View releases at https://github.com/thatAverageGuy/mono-quant/releases
- Use CI/CD for automated testing/publishing

<next_action>
**ALL DISTRIBUTION TASKS COMPLETE!**

The v1.0 milestone is 100% complete with all distribution channels active.

**Options for next work:**
1. **Create v2 milestone** - Plan new features (genetic optimization, experiment tracking, etc.)
2. **Minor improvements** - Add more tests, examples, benchmarks
3. **Monitor and improve** - Watch CI/CD runs, fix issues as they arise
4. **Take a break** - Project is in great shape!

**To continue with planning:**
- Run `/gsd:new-milestone` to start v2.0 planning
- Or run `/gsd:resume-work` to see this handoff

**To create PR and merge dev to main:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge dev
git push
```
